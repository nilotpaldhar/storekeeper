## About This Project üìå

**Purpose:**  
StoreKeeper is a fully headless e‚Äëcommerce platform built to demonstrate a **modern, scalable, and flexible online store architecture**. It‚Äôs designed for developers and businesses who want a customizable storefront powered by best‚Äëin‚Äëclass APIs for content, commerce, and search.

**Why I Created It:**  
I wanted to showcase my ability to design, architect, and implement a complete full‚Äëstack product ‚Äî from scratch ‚Äî that mirrors real‚Äëworld e‚Äëcommerce requirements such as content management, product synchronization, search, and checkout flows.  
This project serves as a **portfolio piece** and a learning experiment in **composable commerce** using Next.js App Router, Sanity.io, Commerce Layer, and Algolia.

**My Role:**  
This is a **solo‚Äëbuilt** project. I handled everything, including:
- UI/UX design from concept to final responsive implementation  
- Frontend development using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI  
- Backend logic, database schema design (PostgreSQL + Prisma)  
- API integrations with Sanity.io, Commerce Layer, and Algolia  
- Authentication and session handling  
- Deployment, environment setup, and configuration on Vercel

**Design Choice ‚Äì Why Commerce Layer Over Building a Custom Checkout Backend:**  
Building a secure, scalable checkout backend from scratch involves **PCI DSS compliance, payment gateway integrations, inventory management, and tax calculations** ‚Äî all of which are complex and time‚Äëconsuming.  
Commerce Layer offers a **battle‚Äëtested, API‚Äëfirst commerce backend** that handles orders, payments, promotions, inventory, and multi‚Äëcurrency pricing out of the box.  
It integrates cleanly into a headless architecture, allowing me to focus on the **user experience and business logic** rather than reinventing the entire e‚Äëcommerce backend.
